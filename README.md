# ‚ú® Voyara - AI-Powered Itinerary Generator

Voyara is a sleek, modern web application that crafts personalized travel itineraries in seconds. Users can specify a destination, desired "vibe," and the number of days for their trip. Our AI-powered planner then generates a detailed, day-by-day schedule with specific timings, streamed to the user in real-time and beautifully presented. Logged-in users can save their favorite trips, view them later, and share them with others via a unique link.
